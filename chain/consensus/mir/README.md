# Mir Consensus

The code in this package integrates the Mir framework with the implementation over Mir
of a pBFT consensus. This consensus can be used as an alternative consensus to FilecoinEC
in Lotus.

## Requirements
Lotus and [Mir](https://github.com/filecoin-project/mir) requirements must be satisfied.
The most important one is Go1.18+, with that you are probably able to figure out the rest yourself.

## Install
To use Mir in lotus, you need to compile the code with `make spacenet`. This will output
`lotus`, `lotus-miner` for their use with Mir and a `mir-validator` process. This last process
is the one that needs to be run by validators to produce new blocks in the network.
```
git clone git@github.com:filecoin-project/lotus.git
cd lotus
git submodule update --init --recursive
make spacenet
```

## Run

The easiest way to run a three-nodes network is to leverage the scripts provided in `./scripts/mir`. To run the network you just need to run the following scripts in different terminals:
```
# Terminal 1 (daemon for node 0)
./scripts/mir/daemon.sh 0
# Terminal 2 (daemon for node 1)
./scripts/mir/daemon.sh 1
# Terminal 3 (daemon for node 2)
./scripts/mir/daemon.sh 2
# Terminal 4 (daemon for node 0)
./scripts/mir/validator.sh 0
# Terminal 5 (daemon for node 1)
./scripts/mir/validator.sh 1
# Terminal 6 (daemon for node 2)
./scripts/mir/validator.sh 2
```
If you rather deploy your own custom network, follow the steps provided in the [mir validator README](../../../cmd/mir-validator) to learn how to configure and deploy your own validators, and how to set-up the membership list.

### Automated 4-node network
If you don't even want to know what is happening under-the-hood, and you just want to run a 4-node network fast, run `./scripts/mir/4-node-net.sh`.
